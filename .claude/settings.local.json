All generated code MUST pass validation gates\nbefore being presented to the user. Claude generates, system validates.\n\nBacklog established:\n- 24 tasks across 5 phases (Foundation → Validation → UX → Distribution → Polish)\n- Future extensibility for domain-specific validation (HFT, Game Dev, Embedded, Security)\n\nFiles:\n- CLAUDE.md: AI guidance with mandatory commit rules\n- kanban.md: Full backlog with architecture diagram\n- docs/readme.md: Project vision and scope\n- docs/project_state.md: Current state and target architecture\n- docs/decisions.md: 7 ADRs documenting architectural choices\n- amp.agent.md: Reference implementation from Amp (Go agent pattern)\n- concept files: Initial brainstorming\n\nSee: kanban.md for full backlog\n\n🤖 Generated with Claude Code (claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",

The Amp article\nwas reference material for Go patterns, not a directive to build an agent.\n\nKey Changes:\n- ADR-004 revised: \"CLI-Orchestrated Pipeline with Mandatory Validation\"\n- Removed all agent/tool terminology from architecture docs\n- bjarne controls: prompt → generate → validate → iterate → display\n- Claude''s role: purely code generation (no tool calls)\n\nArchitecture:\n- Interactive REPL (TTY-style, like Claude Code)\n- Future: /command menu (/save, /help, /validate, /clear)\n- bjarne orchestrates Bedrock calls and validation pipeline\n- Validation cannot be bypassed (controlled by bjarne, not Claude)\n\nBacklog reorganized:\n- Phase 1: Foundation (Go module, REPL, Bedrock client)\n- Phase 2: Validation Container (Dockerfile, runtime detection, pipeline)\n- Phase 3: Core Workflow (integration, iteration, save command)\n- Phase 4: UX (first-run, flags, colors, /commands)\n- Phase 5: Distribution (GitHub Actions, releases)\n- Phase 6: Polish (limits, model selection, validate-only mode)\n\nSee: kanban.md for updated backlog\n\n🤖 Generated with Claude Code (claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
