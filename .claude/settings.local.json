All generated code MUST pass validation gates\nbefore being presented to the user. Claude generates, system validates.\n\nBacklog established:\n- 24 tasks across 5 phases (Foundation → Validation → UX → Distribution → Polish)\n- Future extensibility for domain-specific validation (HFT, Game Dev, Embedded, Security)\n\nFiles:\n- CLAUDE.md: AI guidance with mandatory commit rules\n- kanban.md: Full backlog with architecture diagram\n- docs/readme.md: Project vision and scope\n- docs/project_state.md: Current state and target architecture\n- docs/decisions.md: 7 ADRs documenting architectural choices\n- amp.agent.md: Reference implementation from Amp (Go agent pattern)\n- concept files: Initial brainstorming\n\nSee: kanban.md for full backlog\n\n🤖 Generated with Claude Code (claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
