# BJARNE TASKS
_Last reviewed: 2025-12-05_

## Active
- [ ] Test MSan with real-world code generation scenarios
- [ ] Verify 15-attempt escalation works correctly

## Backlog
- [ ] `/init` command - Workspace indexing for codebase context
  - Scan current folder and subdirectories
  - Process all source files (.cpp, .h, .c, .hpp)
  - Create index of: functions, classes, structs, includes, dependencies
  - Storage options to evaluate:
    - bjarne.index.json (simple, portable)
    - SQLite (queryable, scales better)
    - Embedded DB (bbolt, badger)
  - Goal: Pull relevant context when user asks for code that integrates with existing codebase
  - Similar to Claude Code's codebase indexing
  - Consider: file hashes for incremental updates, AST parsing vs regex

- [ ] Collapsible code blocks with mouse interaction (requires alt screen mode)
- [ ] Multi-file project support (header + implementation)
- [ ] Property-based testing with FuzzTest
- [ ] Domain-specific validators (HFT, embedded, gamedev)
- [ ] Benchmark gate for performance-sensitive code
- [ ] CI/CD integration - GitHub Action for bjarne validation

## Completed
- [x] MSan support with instrumented libc++
- [x] 15-attempt escalation with clear thresholds
- [x] Improved fix prompts with sanitizer guidance
- [x] LLM now receives full code + errors during fix iterations
- [x] Question detection for EASY tasks
- [x] Safe C functions rules in generation prompt
- [x] Code reveal animation

### Rules
- Keep 1-3 items active (WIP <= 3)
- When done:
  1. Commit with descriptive message
  2. Move to Completed section
